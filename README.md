xmlconfig is an extension of [tinyxml][www.sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml] 
that provides a very limited XPath like interface into xml files. It has built 
invalue cacheing, and maintains awareness of the xml file state, so look ups 
are quick and values are up to date with the original xml file.
